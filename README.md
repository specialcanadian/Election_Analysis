* A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* Which county had the largest number of votes
* A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* County Votes:
  * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

## Election Audit Summary

The code could be modified for the Presidential Election. Instead of looking at counties, it could look at what state the vote came from.

It could also be used for city elections, changing the counties to zip codes.
